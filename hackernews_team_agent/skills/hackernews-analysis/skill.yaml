  overview: |
    Multi-agent team that coordinates HackerNews story analysis.
    Uses three specialized agents: HackerNews Researcher (fetches top stories),
    Article Reader (extracts full content), and Web Searcher (enriches with research).
    Built on Agno framework with OpenRouter models and structured output.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - "News aggregation and curation platforms"
      - "Trend analysis and monitoring"
      - "Automated newsletter generation"
      - "Content research and summarization"

    when_not_to_use:
      - "Real-time chat or conversational interfaces"
      - "Non-HackerNews content analysis"
      - "Low-latency requirements (< 5 seconds)"

  input_structure: |
    Natural language queries about HackerNews stories.

    Example:
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the top AI stories on HackerNews?"
    }

    Constraints:
    - Plain text or JSON format
    - Query should reference HackerNews or trending topics
    - No specific parameter structure required

  output_format: |
    Structured Article model with title, summary, and reference links.

    Success Response:
    {
      "title": "AI Trends on HackerNews",
      "summary": "Comprehensive analysis of top stories...",
      "reference_links": [
        "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=123",
        "https://example.com/article"
      ]
    }

    Error Response:
    {
      "error": "Failed to fetch HackerNews stories"
    }

  error_handling:
    - "API failures: Graceful degradation with partial results"
    - "Article extraction errors: Skip unavailable content"
    - "Timeout: 30-second limit per agent operation"
    - "Invalid queries: Return error message with guidance"
    - "Rate limits: Automatic retry with exponential backoff"

  examples:
    - title: "Top AI Stories"
      input:
        role: "user"
        content: "What are the top AI stories on HackerNews?"
      output:
        title: "Top AI Stories on HackerNews"
        summary: "Analysis of trending AI discussions..."
        reference_links:
          - "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=123"

    - title: "Trending Stories Summary"
      input:
        role: "user"

          - "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=456"

  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Use async/await for all agent operations"
      - "Implement graceful degradation for partial failures"
      - "Cache API responses to reduce latency"
      - "Test with various query types and edge cases"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route HackerNews-related queries to this skill"
      - "Chain with content summarization or sentiment analysis skills"
      - "Expect 10-30 second processing time per request"
      - "Implement retry logic with exponential backoff"
      - "Monitor agent response times and API rate limits"
